# pocPlayClueless
A small proof of concept for working with the layouts for logic and pencil games. Specifically, it is for playing clueless crosswords on your computer.

The final project is meant to be written using Unity, Blazor or Fabulous for the interface. This version turned out to be more entertaining to play than I expected, so I put it up here on git.

It depends on my printable games project to build. Note to developers, the WPF portions do not even slightly resemble idiomatic MVVM style code.
