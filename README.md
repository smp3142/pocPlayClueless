# pocPlayClueless
A small proof of concept for working with the layouts for logic and pencil games.

Specifically, it is for playing clueless crosswords on your computer.
It depends on my printable games project to build.

The final project is meant to be written using Unity or Blazor for the interface. This version turned out to be more entertaining to play than I expected, so I put it up here on git.
